# project-tv-script-generation
In this project, I generate My own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs using part of the Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network built will generate a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.

# Here's an overview of the steps involved in the "Generate TV Scripts" project:

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   You'll start by loading and preprocessing the TV script dataset. This could involve tokenizing the text, converting words to numerical representations, and creating sequences of words that will serve as inputs and targets for the model.

2. **Building the RNN Model:**
   You'll construct a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture, often using frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells are commonly used for this type of text generation task. The RNN will learn patterns from the input data and generate new sequences of text.

3. **Training the Model:**
   During the training phase, you'll feed the input sequences into the RNN and compare the generated output with the target sequences. The model's parameters will be updated using backpropagation and gradient descent to minimize the difference between the predicted and actual sequences.

4. **Generating TV Scripts:**
   After training, you'll use the trained RNN to generate new TV scripts. You'll provide a seed or initial text, and the model will generate subsequent words or lines based on the patterns it learned during training. The generated scripts should resemble the style and tone of the original TV show.

5. **Evaluation and Fine-Tuning:**
   You'll evaluate the quality of the generated scripts by reading and assessing their coherence, relevance, and humor (if applicable). If necessary, you can fine-tune the model's parameters or architecture to improve the quality of the generated text.

6. **Project Documentation:**
   As with any project, you'll create documentation that explains your approach, the architecture of your RNN model, the data preprocessing steps, and the results you achieved. You might also discuss any challenges you faced and how you addressed them.
